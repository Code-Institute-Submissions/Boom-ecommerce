## Features
### Global Features
- Responsive Navbar with logotype, search bar, categories dropdown, and user icons such as login, cart, profile. In smaller screens, all the features unless the Logo, are wrapped in a hamburger icon.
- The Search bar displays the results on the search view.
- Cart icon displays amount of items in cart.
Footer with another version of the logo and links to social accounts, blog, FAQ, and Contact Us.

#### Home page
In this page a motivating gif is displayed at the beginning of the page, followed by the 3 images that link with the specified product category.
A "new arrivals" section with only 4 products,  "Deal of the week" which is a simple product image that can be customized by id and finally an offer section with links to (future) student discounts, Swedish payment option, and (future) workout app.

#### Products page
Main Product list page. This page lists all products available. Each product has an image, price and name linked to the detail view of the item. The same template is reused to display products depending on the category selected. On the left side of the page, filters by price and categories can be found.

#### Product detail page
On this page, the product image is displayed bigger, user can see the name, description, price, and a quantity form which automatically stats in 1. When a user click add to cart, will be redirected to all products view (To impulse more purchases) and a success message will be displayed notifying that the cart has been updated.

#### Search Page
This page follows the same structure of the "products page". The user is redirected to there where relevant results are displayed.

#### Cart
Users can access their cart by clicking the cart icon. There a clean table with image, product name, quantity, price, subtotal, delete product and total amount to pay are in place.
The quantity can be modified directly by clicking in + or - icons. If the quantity is reduced to 0, then the product will be automatically deleted from the cart, deducting its value from the total amount to pay.
Two buttons are provided to either go back shopping that link to "products page" or proceed to checkout.
Price is automatically calculated after add, edit or remove items.

#### Checkout
Users can access the checkout functionality by clicking the button "proceed to checkout" in cart. If the user is not logged In, will be redirected to the login page, with an aim of recording customer information. Otherwise will be connected to the Stripe's API, where the shopping list with the products name, quantity, and price can be seen.

If the user has to login, items will persist in cart after successful login.
If payment is processed, the user is redirected to payment_success page.
#### Contact Us
Simple and clean page with contact information, a contact form for questions, feedback, or partnership purposes.
Finally, a Google Maps API is in place with the coordinates of our "central office" in Sweden.
